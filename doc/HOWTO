0. Install required tools. Here's an example of requred commands for a clean
GENI ubuntu vm.

# Get bibliography formatting code.
git clone https://github.com/colleagueoftheprophetoffloyd/bibformatting.git bib

# Set up python prerequisites.
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install unidecode

# Get bib2x and add to path.
cd
curl -O http://www.xandi.eu/bib2x/files/dist/bib2x_0.9.1_src.tgz
tar xf bib2x_0.9.1_src.tgz 
cd bib2x-0.9.1
./configure
make
sudo make install
sudo apt-get install libodb-dev

1. Download articles tagged as "include" from the GENI-candidate citeulike group.
From  http://www.citeulike.org/bibtex_options/group/17031/tag/include/order/author,,, set Key Type to "Prefer Numeric Keys," select Export to BibTeX and save file "group-include-17031.bib"

2. Clear GENI public group and upload the articles just downloaded.
Go to http://www.citeulike.org/group/17050/tag/no-tag
Choose "delete all no-tag articles".
Confirm.
Check that there are now no articles.
Go to http://www.citeulike.org/groupfunc/17050/import_go, and use these form settings:
Under "Use a file on your hard drive," select group-include-17031.bib exported in last step
Under "What tag?," clear the "tags" box and select "Don't import any tags"
Under "What about duplicates," select "Update existing records for matching keys," "Matching: CiteULike article ID," and "replace existing tags with what's in the file"
Verify that there are now an appropriate number of articles (about 350 as of May 2017).

3. Process bibliography.
sh ./crunch-bib.sh

4. Upload results.
Go to http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/GENIBibliography
Upload new bibliography file (remember to check the box to replace current version)
Insert newly formatted html from result-files/formatted-geni-bibliography.html in place of the old version.
